John landed at Berlinâ€™s airport, excited to eat bratwurst.
I had a delicious Bratwurst at the Berlin airport.
But, when John arrived at the baeckerei he was greeted by a hund at the door.
I couldn't help but notice the hund's resemblence to the bratwurst.
John then went to the garden to have a beer.
