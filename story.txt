John landed at Berlinâ€™s airport, excited to eat bratwurst.
I had a delicious Bratwurst at the Berlin airport.
But, when John arrived at the baeckerei he was greeted by a hund at the door.
I couldn't help but notice the hund's resemblence to the bratwurst.
John then went to the garden to have a beer.
John didn't exepct the pass Eltz with guards wearing lederhose!
John considered stealing a BMW to escape the guards, before deciding he wanted to steal a porsche instead. 
He hopped into the Porsche and hot-wired it as fast as he could so that he could escape to the nearest eltz.
