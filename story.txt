John landed at Berlinâ€™s airport, excited to eat bratwurst.
I had a delicious Bratwurst at the Berlin airport.
But, when John arrived at the baeckerei he was greeted by a hund at the door.
I couldn't help but notice the hund's resemblence to the bratwurst.
John then went to the biergarten to have several beers.
John didn't exepct the pass Eltz with guards wearing lederhose!
John considered stealing a BMW to escape the guards, before deciding he wanted to steal a porsche instead. 
He hopped into the Porsche and hot-wired it as fast as he could so that he could escape to the nearest eltz.
As soon as he got the car running, the stereo started blasting Rammstein on full volume.
He headed to the castle at 90kph to see a party of women wearing dirndels.
The women were wettbewerbsfaehig and challenged John do a battle of baking gebaeck.
He grabbed all the Gebaeck and took off with one of the women's BMW.
